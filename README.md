## Hypermodularity with WebStream 
There are times when you need to see what your components will look like outside of the complete UI because they will be reused throughout a project or across multiple projects. This can be a task in itself if it isnâ€™t a consideration from the beginning of a project.

In this talk, attendees will learn how the WebStream includes modular libraries to do component-driven development from the start. 

You will learn how to implement components in modular components and how that helps you with the long-term maintenance of a project.
